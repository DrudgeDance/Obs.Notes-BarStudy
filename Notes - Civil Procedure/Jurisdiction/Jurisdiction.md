Arthur Miller's Jurisdiction Checklist -- Seven Questions to ask:
1. Does the court thave subject matter jurisdiction?  i.e., does the court have the power to hear this dispute? [[Article III]]
2. Does the court have [[Jurisdiction - Personal]] or [[Jurisdiction - Property]] over the defendant? [[Due Process]]
3. Has the defendant been given notice and an opportunity to hear and be heard? [[Due Process]]
4. Has there been proper service of process? [[Federal Rules Of Civil Procedure 4]]
5. Does the court have [[Venue]]? Is the case properly located within the system?
6. If the question puts into a state court can the case be [[removed to a federal court]]?  Can the case be [[remanded]] from the Federal Court once removed to a Federal Court?  (Removal is a one-way street from State Ct. to Federal Ct.). #Exam/LowProbability
7. Have any of the preceding six issues been waived?  [[Jurisdiction - Subject Matter]] <u>CANNOT</u> be waived as it is foundational.  
	1. Have to assert many of these defenses
	2. Some defenses are [[timebound]] and waived if not asserted within a timeframe.
